.Prerequisites
* Update https://github.com/r3dact3d/fluffy-ee/settings/secrets/actions[GitHub Secrets]
** AH_TOKEN - Galaxy or Automation Hub API Key (needs to provide creds for ee_ah_host)
** EE_REGISTRY_PASSWORD - DockerHub or Image Registry Password

NOTE: These secrets get passed during the GitHub Actions workflow.
  This method is easy for demo but maynot meet production requirements link:https://github.com/r3dact3d/fluffy-ee/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-ee.yml#L29["Passing Secrets"]

.Example - Need to update if forked
. `ee_registry_dest` - My personal link:https://hub.docker.com/repositories/r3dact3d["Docker Hub"]
. `ee_registry_username` - My username for Docker Hub - the password is supplied to GitHub Secrets and passed in workflow
. `ee_ah_host` - FQDN of Hub to get collections, I chose to just use link:galaxy.ansible.com["Ansible Galaxy"] for ease of use
