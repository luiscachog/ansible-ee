.Example - Need to update if forked
. link:https://github.com/r3dact3d/fluffy-ee/blob/main/fluffy-builder.yml#L9["ee_registry_dest"] - Currently set to my personal link:https://hub.docker.com/repositories/r3dact3d["Docker Hub"]
. link:https://github.com/r3dact3d/fluffy-ee/blob/main/fluffy-builder.yml#L10["ee_registry_username"] - Update to reflect username for the `ee_registry_dest` value
. link:https://github.com/r3dact3d/fluffy-ee/blob/main/fluffy-builder.yml#L12["ee_ah_host"] - FQDN of Hub to get collections, I chose link:galaxy.ansible.com["Ansible Galaxy"] for ease of use
